## Overview

The Project Management System (PMS) is a web platform designed to streamline teamwork and task management.  
Developed as part of the ΠΛΗ513 – Services in Cloud and Fog Computing course at the Technical University of Crete, it emulates simplified functionality of tools like Jira or Trello, focusing on collaboration, progress tracking, and team communication.

The system supports different user roles (Admin, Team Leader, Team Member) and allows the creation, assignment, and monitoring of tasks in an organized environment.

---

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- Multi-role user authentication (Admin / Team Leader / Member)
- Team and member management
- Task lifecycle tracking (TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE)
- Deadlines and task priorities
- Comment and discussion threads
- File uploads for task attachments
- Notifications for comments or changes
- Comment and discussion threads with optional file attachments  
  (Team Leaders and Members can upload a file when posting a comment)

### Optional / Bonus Features
- Dashboard analytics and team progress charts
- File attachments in comments
- Real-time notifications via WebSockets (optional)

---

## System Architecture

The PMS follows a modular architecture consisting of:

- Frontend Layer: Jinja2 templates, HTML/CSS/JS
- Backend Layer: Flask blueprints for modular services
- Database Layer: PostgreSQL relational schema

### Data Flow
```
User → Flask Routes (Blueprints) → Service Logic → PostgreSQL DB
```

### Main Components
| Component       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Auth Service    | Manages user authentication and sessions  |
| Team Service    | Handles teams and members                 |
| Task Service    | Manages tasks and statuses                |
| Comment Service | Adds comments to tasks                    |

## Database Schema

### Entities

The PostgreSQL schema is defined in **`create_tables.sql`** and includes:

| Table            | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **users**        | Stores all system users (admins, leaders, members)        |
| **teams**        | Represents team entities with assigned leaders            |
| **team_members** | Many-to-many relationship between teams and users         |
| **tasks**        | Represents team tasks with priority, status, and due date |
| **comments**     | Stores user comments per task (with timestamps)           |


- users(user_id, username, email, password, role, is_active)
- teams(team_id, name, description, leader_id, created_at)
- team_members(team_id, user_id) (many-to-many)
- tasks(task_id, title, description, status, priority, due_date, created_by, assigned_to)
- comments(comment_id, task_id, user_id, text, file_path, created_at)

To initialize the database:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d project_db -f databe_sql/create_tables.sql
```

Initialize schema and data (sequentially):

```bash
psql -U postgres -d project_db -f databe_sql/create_tables.sql
psql -U postgres -d project_db -f databe_sql/create_data.sql
```

## Configuration

Example: `config.py`
```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "project_db",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "xotour"
}
SECRET_KEY = "supersecretkey"
UPLOAD_FOLDER = "static/uploads"
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {"png", "jpg", "pdf"}
```

---

## Quickstart Guide

### Local Environment Setup (Development Mode)

Follow these steps to run the Project Management System locally without Docker:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/stamatis-mavitzis/project-management-system.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd project-management-system

# 3. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install all required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Initialize the PostgreSQL database schema and data
cd database_sql
chmod +x create_tables.sh
./create_tables.sh

# 6. Return to the main project directory
cd ..

# 7. Run the Flask development server
python backend_server_app.py
```

Once the application starts successfully, open your browser and visit:

👉 **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

This will launch the PMS web interface, where you can:
- **Sign up or log in** as Admin, Team Leader, or Team Member.  
- **Manage teams and tasks** interactively.  
- **Upload attachments**, **add comments**, and **track progress** in real time.

#### Notes
- Ensure **PostgreSQL** is installed and running on your system.  
  If not, the `create_tables.sh` script will install and configure it automatically.
- Default database credentials (editable in `config.py`):
  ```
  DB_USER=nefos
  DB_PASSWORD=xotour
  DB_NAME=project_db
  DB_HOST=localhost
  ```
- To reset the database, run `recreate_database.sh` (included in `database_sql/`).

```json
{"team_name": "DevOps", "description": "CI/CD team", "leader_id": 3}
```

**GET /teams**
Returns all teams related to the logged-in user.

---

### Task Service
**POST /tasks**

Both Team Leaders and Members can attach a file when submitting a comment.
Uploaded files are stored under `static/uploads/` and are linked to the associated
task comment. Allowed file types are defined in `config.py` through the
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS setting.

```json
{"comment_text": "Testing completed", "user_id": 4}
```

**GET /tasks/<task_id>/comments**
Retrieves all comments for the specified task.

---

## Security & Error Handling

- Passwords hashed using Werkzeug.
- Flask session-based authentication.
- Input validation for SQL safety.
- Custom error messages and flash notifications.

Error example:
```json
{"error": "Invalid credentials"}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Port 5000 busy | Another app running | Change host port in docker-compose.yml |
| Database connection error | Postgres not healthy | Run `docker compose logs db` |
| Flask not reloading | Missing volume bind | Ensure `- .:/app` is included |

---

## PostgreSQL Server Setup

This section explains how to create and initialize the local PostgreSQL server and database for the Project Management System (ΠΛΗ513).

It uses the helper script `create_tables.sh` to automatically install, configure, and import your database.

---

### Requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 or later  
- PostgreSQL: Installed locally or will be installed by the script  
- File Required: `database.sql` (schema + data)

---

### What the Script Does

`create_tables.sh` performs all the following automatically:

1. Installs PostgreSQL if missing.  
2. Starts and enables the PostgreSQL service.  
3. Creates a PostgreSQL user `nefos` with password `xotour`.  
4. Creates the database `project_db` owned by `nefos`.  
5. Imports all schema and data from `database.sql`.  
6. Tests the connection to confirm a valid setup.

---

### Setup Instructions

1. Redirect your project directory in `database_sql`:
```bash
cd database_sql
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x create_tables.sh
```

3. Run the setup script:
```bash
./create_tables.sh
```

The script will:
- Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)
- Start the PostgreSQL service
- Create user `nefos` (password `xotour`)
- Create database `project_db`
- Import schema and data automatically

---

### Verify Installation

Check that the tables were created:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -d project_db -c "\dt"
```

Or connect using the created user:
```bash
PGPASSWORD="xotour" psql -U nefos -d project_db -h localhost
```

If you can see the database tables, your setup is complete.

---

### Optional: Quick Database Reset

If you are testing frequently and need to reset your local database:

Create a helper script `recreate_database.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS project_db;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE project_db OWNER nefos;"
sudo -u postgres psql -d project_db -f database.sql
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x recreate_database.sh
```

Run:
```bash
./recreate_database.sh
```

This will cleanly drop and reimport all schema and data from `database.sql`.

---

### Example Terminal Output

```
Starting PostgreSQL setup...
---------------------------------------
PostgreSQL is already installed.
Ensuring PostgreSQL service is running...
Database 'project_db' and user 'nefos' created successfully.
Importing schema and data from database.sql ...
Database import completed successfully.
Testing connection...
Connection test successful! Setup completed.
---------------------------------------
Setup finished. Database 'project_db' ready for use.
```
